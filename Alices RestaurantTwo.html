<p>"<strong>Alice's Restaurant Massacree</strong>", commonly known as "<strong>Alice's Restaurant</strong>", is a musical monologue by singer-songwriter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlo_Guthrie">Arlo Guthrie</a>, released on his 1967 debut album <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Restaurant_%28album%29">Alice's Restaurant</a></em>. It is notable as a satirical, first-person account of 1960s counterculture, in addition to being a hit song in its own right and an inspiration for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Restaurant_%28film%29">1969 movie</a> of the same name. The song is one of Guthrie's most prominent works, based on a true incident from his life that began on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_%28United_States%29">Thanksgiving Day</a> 1965 with a citation for littering, and ended with the refusal of the U.S. Army to draft him because of his conviction for that crime. The ironic punch line of the story is that, in the words of Guthrie, "I'm sittin' here on the Group W bench 'cause you want to know if I'm moral enough to join the Army—burn women, kids, houses and villages—after bein' a litterbug." The final part of the song is an encouragement for the listeners to sing along, to resist the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States">draft</a>, and to end war.</p>

<p>Apart from the chorus which begins and ends it, the "song" is in fact a spoken <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monologue">monologue</a>, with a constantly repeated fingerstyle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragtime#Historical_context">ragtime guitar (Piedmont style)</a> guitar backing. It lasts 18 minutes and 34 seconds, occupying the entire A-side of the <em>Alice's Restaurant</em> album. The work has become Guthrie's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature_song">signature song</a> and he has periodically re-released it with updated lyrics.</p>

In 2003, it was still two magnitudes brighter than its baseline, and dimming at a rate of 0.02 magnitude a year. Its distance has been calculated as 5000±800 parsecs (16,300 light-years), which puts its location in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_halo">galactic halo</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Minor#cite_note-bianchini2003-54">[50]</a></p>
